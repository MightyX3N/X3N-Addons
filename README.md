##For X3NAmbience Color Corrections Base
Simply all you need to do is rename the main folder, to whatever you color correction addon should be called

Then go into the "\lua\colorcorrections" folder and just add the .lua files you created here and your done!

make sure your .lua files has a very unique name (or else they will conflict with others)
you can use this [https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=20&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=20&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new) it will generate a 20 charectar long random name use that

for example:
tqcwsdtqzavmtefzucfc.lua
txgvupoizaansnaujriw.lua
dkkxbzfuiqtcleohmipi.lua

(i would suggest naming it what it is, then add your steam name to it like so example: mightyx3n-crazyrealism.lua)
