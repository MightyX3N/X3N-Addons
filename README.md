Simply all you need to do is rename the main folder, to whatever you ambience addon should be called

Then go into the "\AmbienceOfTheRow\sound\Ambience" folder and just add the .mp3 files you want here and your done!

make sure your .mp3 files has a very unique name 
you can use this [https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=20&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=20&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new) it will generate a 20 charectar long random name use that

for example:
tqcwsdtqzavmtefzucfc.mp3
txgvupoizaansnaujriw.mp3
dkkxbzfuiqtcleohmipi.mp3

Do not use the examples as they may be used by others!
